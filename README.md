This repo contains the Yeah Baby Goods theme wrapped around a custom React app for the highchair customizer. The Customizer app is completely contained in the `react` folder, and is integrated with the Shopify theme in `templates/page.customizer-custom.liquid` file.

To start the app run `shopify theme serve` from the root and `npm install && npm run build` from the `react` folder.
